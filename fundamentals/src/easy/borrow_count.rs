/*
  Problem 9: Borrow and Count

  Write a function that takes an immutable reference to a Vec<i32> and returns the count of elements greater than a given threshold.
  This exercises borrowing without taking ownership.

  Run the tests for this problem with:
    cargo test --test borrow_count_test
*/

pub fn count_above(values: &Vec<i32>, threshold: i32) -> usize {
    let mut count = 0;
    for i in values {
        if i > &threshold{
            count += 1;
        }
    }
    count
}
